AZ-104 Lab 06 – Implement Network Traffic Management
📌 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of Azure Network Traffic Management based on AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator – Lab 06.

The objective of this lab is to configure and manage network traffic flow using Azure Load Balancer and Network Security Groups (NSGs) to ensure high availability and secure access to virtual machines.

🎯 Objectives

Implement Azure network traffic management

Configure Azure Load Balancer

Manage inbound and outbound traffic using NSGs

Validate traffic flow and high availability

Document the implementation with screenshots

🛠️ Azure Services Used

Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

Subnets

Virtual Machines (Windows/Linux)

Azure Load Balancer (Standard)

Network Security Groups (NSG)

Public IP Address

🧱 Architecture Overview

Multiple VMs deployed in the same VNet

Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic

NSG rules control inbound and outbound access

Health probes monitor VM availability

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Created a Virtual Network and Subnets

Deployed multiple Virtual Machines

Created and configured a Standard Load Balancer

Frontend IP configuration

Backend pool

Health probe

Load balancing rule

Configured Network Security Group rules

Inbound rules (HTTP / SSH / RDP as required)

Outbound rules

Tested traffic distribution and VM accessibility

Documented the complete process with screenshots

✅ Outcome

Successfully implemented traffic distribution across VMs

Verified secure access using NSG rules

Achieved high availability using Azure Load Balancer

Gained hands-on experience with Azure networking concepts
